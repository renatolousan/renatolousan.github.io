            <h2>How do I do it?</h2>

            <p>First, make sure the monitor speakers are at the same depth in your desk, this is easily done with a tape
                measure or with a fancy laser level. Then, measure the distance between the monitors. Note that the
                distance from the monitors are <strong> measured from tweeter to tweeter</strong>. Now, it is time to
                measure your distance from the speakers. </p>
            <p>
                To measure your distance from the speakers is a bit trickier, because you have to set a reference within
                the monitors front panel. In my tests, the <strong> farthest side of the front panel</strong> yielded
                better results than from any other point, that is because they serve as a great pivot point to factor in
                all elements from your studio monitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, initiate the measure from the above chosen point to your left/right ear. The number read at the
                measured tape right next to your ear is the depth distance!

            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <img src="Untitled Diagram.png" alt="Description" width="600">
            <p>In an ideal scenario, the monitors should be placed in a 60 degree angle to form a perfect triangle
                (60+60+60 degree triangle). But not always the listener can be at a distance from the speakers where a
                60 degree angle is optimal. In my case, I am at 70cm from my speakers (D) and the speakers are 93cm
                apart from each other (W). So, to calculate my horizontal angle from the speakers, we use the horizontal
                field of view formula as follows:</p>
            <img src="formula1.png" alt="Description" width="600">
            <p>And then, we plug in the values measured:</p>
            <img src="formula2.png" alt="Description" width="600">
            <p>Now, we calculate the complement angles of our triangle:</p>
            <img src="formula3.png" alt="Description" width="600">
            <p>Plugging in our example values:</p>
            <img src="formula4.png" alt="Description" width="600">
            <p>And that's it! Now you have your perfect triangle and you can enjoy your music with perfect centrality!
